    <h2>Ketosis</h2>
    <p>I'm sure you're reading this wondering, what on earth is Ketosis? Ketosis is a process in the body in which your deprive the body of carbohydrates and sugar. Our bodies use carbs and sugar to function as a source of energy! If we get rid of Carbs + Sugar, our bodies get confused and wonders where it's going to get its energy from. At that point, the body will start producing ketones that is produced in the liver and kick starts a process in the body called Ketosis that changes the way the body gets its energy from in which is starts to get energy from our fat stores. </p>

    <h2>Why is Ketosis so great?</h2>
    <p>Ketosis is a great way to change the way your body retrieves and utilize energy. Because in recent times, we have relied on carbs for energy, our bodies crash when we don't have carbs. Once you change, and your body starts to rely on fat for energy, we are constantly running on our own fat stores which is a much more sustainable why to operate. </p>

    <h2>Induce</h2>
    <p>Inducing can be quite the experience. We have been eating carbs and sugars for a very long time, however it's not the way humans have been eating for thousands of years. The caveman ate mostly proteins and healthy fats wwhich is what we eat when leading the ketogenic lifestyle. Because carbs and sugars have been part of daily lives for years now, our bodies have adjusted to this way of depending on carbohydrates for energy. Once you deplete the way our bodies have been running, it's not going to be happy. With that said, your body goes through a carbohydrate withdrawal and that process is called "Keto-Flu". It feels just like it sounds; A flu. Ketosis acts like a dieuretic and we lose a lot of electrolytes so lack of nutrients will make us feel sick. This process lasts about a week, however there are ways to help cope with the symptoms.  </p>

    <p>You can eat a lot of good food in ketosis. Mainly the foods eaten during ketosis is vert high fat and moderate protein. It's a common misconception that fat is the enemy, but in reality, carbs and sugar are the culprits that cause a lot of health problems. Meats, Fish, Eggs and Nute are the main sources of protein and as far as healthy fats go, you can have Butter, Bacon, Coconut oil, Olive oil, Fish oil, Cheese, and Avocado's are great sources of fats.
